    The reality is, most pre-workout labels are impossible for the average customer to interpret — it seems as though only a biochemist could interpret the ingredients. At the end of the day, it is important for consumers to understand the impact that each compound has on their body and how it can improve exercise performance. Given the right information, consumers can choose their performance supplements more intelligently.

<h2 class="section-heading">Beta-Alanine</h2>
<p>
    Found mainly in pork and red meat, beta-alanine is part of the family of non-essential amino acids. It is one of the most common ingredients in pre-workout formulas for its plethora of medical literature proving its significant increases in performance. Beta-alanine is a synthesized in the liver and has shown to increase carnosine synthesis by bonding to L-Histidine. Beta-alanine acts as a lactic acid buffer for muscles— allowing for increases in training capacity during high intensity interval training[1]. Beta-alanine is known to be the cause of a tingling sensation of the skin users commonly describe.

<h2 class="section-heading">L-Citrulline</h2>
<p>
    Another member of the non-essential amino acids, L-Citrulline increases nitric oxide synthesis. Naturally found in Watermelon, L-Citrulline is converted into l-arginine in the kidney when taken orally. This compound helps fuel oxygen to your muscles in an efficient manner. This allows for more power output for longer periods of time which is beneficial for endurance sports. Often combined with malic acid to produce L-Citrulline Malate: L-Citrulline Malate was proven to increase anerobic power[2] and increase endurance[3]. Users will likely notice an increase in vascularity or the pump feeling during physical activity.

<h2 class="section-heading">Betaine Anydrous</h2>
<p>
    Betainine or trimethylglycine (TMG) is a methyl group donor. This compound is an import contributor in the transmethylation of homocysteine back to methionine. High homocysteine are attributed to weakening insulin signaling which can have a negative impact on fat loss and muscle gain. Methionine is an important amino acid in internal creatine and protein synthesis. TMG is also an osmolyte, which in this case means it can re-hydrate cells (most importantly, your muscles) during activity. TMG has been shown to improve work capacity, power, and improve body composition through these mechanisms[4].

<h2 class="section-heading">Creatine</h2>
<p>
    A highly popular compound, creatine is found commonly in meat, eggs, and fish. Creatine is comprised of the amino acids methionine, glycine, and arginine. It is essential in the body’s production of ATP. Creatine is also an osmolyte — similar to betainine — which is why it is common for users to gain weight when supplementing with creatine. Creatine is able to enter the cells in skeletal muscle and help with hydration. It has been shown to increase lean muscle mass, strength, and exercise volume[9].

<h2 class="section-heading">Cordyceps</h2>
<p>
    A mushroom used in Chinese medicine, cordyceps have been shown to improve endurance in aerobic exercise by increasing oxygen capacity and assisting in producing ATP. Cordyceps have been shown to significantly increase maximal oxygen consumption (V02max) in aerobic athletes[5].
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Schisandra and Ashwagandha</h2>
<p>
    These powerful Ayurvedic herbs can provide a lot to fuel your workouts. Schisandra and Ashwagandha has been shown to help your body adapt to the physical stressors of exercise[6]. Schisandra has been shown to improve blood lactate levels and increase time to exhaustion in swimming athletes[7]. Ashwagandha has also been proven to increase V02max in athletes[8].
